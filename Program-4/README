# Notes:
1.
This is not a login shell, it spawns the shell in your current working,
not your home directory. Switching to home directory can be invoked
with "cd".

2.
The "exit" builtin for some reason refuses to exit the program in valgrind,
however it works perfectly fine in usage and GDB.  Unsure of the cause of this.
